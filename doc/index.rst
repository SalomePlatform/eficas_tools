Welcome to EFICAS's documentation!
==================================

This documentation covers the usage of Eficas as data setting tool in Salome. 
This is intended for end users who want to use Eficas and not for developpers who want to write a catalog. 

The usage of Eficas for OpenTURNS is not described in this guide. Refer to
OpenTURNS module documentation to know how to use Eficas for this code.
