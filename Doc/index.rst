Welcome to EFICAS's documentation!
==================================

This documentation covers the usage of Eficas as data setting tool. 
This is intended for end users who want to use Eficas and not for developpers who want to write a catalog. 

The usage of Eficas for a particular code is not described in this guide. Refer to
code documentation to know how to use Eficas more specifically.
