 What is the EFICAS Graphical User Interface?
</h2>
<body>
<BR>
EFICAS is an open source software which proposes a graphical user interface to OpenTURNS. <BR>
EFICAS enables to the User to lead an uncertainty study without having to learn the python statements.<BR>
<BR>
Eficas is structured in two parts : <BR>
<ul>
<li>1. Part 1 defines the calculus function (the wrapper definition);</li>
<li>2. Part 2 defines the uncertainty study using a previously defined model.</li>
</ul>
note that Part 1 must be fulfilled before Part 2.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It has been made with the following objectives : 
<ul>
<li>1. to ease the use of Open TURNS, avoiding to the User writing the python statements;</li>
<li>2. to ease the learning of the python statements by generating the python script after the study has been graphically defined.</li>
</ul>
<BR>
<BR>
When used, the EFICAS GUI generates :<BR>
</ul>
<li>1. the file.comm which contains all the information declared in the EFICAS GUI. </li>
<li>2. the file.py which is the  python script associated to the study and that can be launched through a python session.</li>
</ul>
